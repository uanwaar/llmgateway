## Reporting a Vulnerability

The LLM Gateway team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**For sensitive security vulnerabilities, please DO NOT open a public issue.**

#### Option 1: GitHub Security Advisories (Recommended)
1. Go to our [Security Advisories page](https://github.com/your-org/llm-gateway/security/advisories)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the advisory form with details about the vulnerability
4. Submit the report

#### Option 2: Email
Send an email to: **security@your-domain.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any proof-of-concept or exploit code (if applicable)
- Your contact information (if you'd like to be credited)

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us understand and resolve the issue quickly, please include:

1. **Vulnerability Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Affected Components**: Which parts of the system are affected
3. **Attack Vector**: How the vulnerability can be exploited
4. **Impact Assessment**: What damage could be caused
5. **Reproduction Steps**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
6. **Proof of Concept**: Safe demonstration (avoid actual exploitation)
7. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### Our Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 7 days
3. **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the report
4. **Fix Development**: We will develop and test a fix
5. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We will coordinate the disclosure timeline with you
6. **Release**: We will release the fix and publish a security advisory

### Response Timeline

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: 24-48 hours for initial response, fix within 7 days
- **High severity**: 48-72 hours for initial response, fix within 14 days  
- **Medium/Low severity**: Within 1 week for response, fix within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure principles:

1. **Private Reporting**: Report vulnerabilities privately first
2. **Coordinated Timeline**: We'll work with you on disclosure timing
3. **Public Disclosure**: After a fix is available and deployed
4. **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (if desired)

### Security Measures

LLM Gateway implements several security measures:

#### Application Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Secure handling of API keys and credentials
- Error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning

#### Infrastructure Security
- Container security with non-root users
- Kubernetes security contexts and RBAC
- Network policies and ingress security
- Secrets management
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipelines

#### Monitoring and Logging
- Comprehensive security logging
- Anomaly detection
- Failed authentication tracking
- Rate limiting monitoring

## Security Best Practices for Users

### API Keys and Credentials
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables or secrets management
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for different environments
- Monitor API key usage for anomalies

### Deployment Security
- Run containers as non-root users
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper network segmentation
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor for security alerts

### Configuration Security
- Review default configurations
- Disable unnecessary features
- Configure proper CORS policies
- Set appropriate rate limits
- Enable security headers

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Monitor for unusual API usage patterns
- Set up alerts for authentication failures
- Track provider API errors
- Monitor resource usage

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as:
- **Patch releases** for critical vulnerabilities
- **Minor releases** for security improvements
- **Security advisories** for all security-related fixes
