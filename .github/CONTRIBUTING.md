## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:
```bash
npm run lint        # Check for issues
npm run lint:fix    # Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run format      # Format code with Prettier
```

### Code Standards

- **ES6+ Features**: Use modern JavaScript features
- **Async/Await**: Prefer async/await over promises
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors appropriately
- **Logging**: Use the centralized logger
- **Security**: Follow security best practices
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications

### Testing

#### Unit Tests
- Located in `tests/unit/`
- Test individual functions and modules
- Use Jest framework
- Aim for high code coverage

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

#### Integration Tests
- Located in `tests/integration/`
- Test interactions between components
- Test API endpoints
- Use real Redis for caching tests

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

#### End-to-End Tests
- Located in `tests/e2e/`
- Test complete user workflows
- Use the full application stack

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update API documentation for endpoint changes
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions
- Update examples if APIs change

### Adding New Providers

To add a new LLM provider:

1. **Create Provider Directory**
   ```

   â”œâ”€â”€ your-provider.client.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ your-provider.models.js
   â””â”€â”€ your-provider.transformer.js
   ```

2. **Implement Required Interfaces**
   - Extend base adapter
   - Implement required methods
   - Add model definitions
   - Create request/response transformers

3. **Add Configuration**
   - Update `config/default.yaml`
   - Add provider settings
   - Document configuration options

4. **Write Tests**
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests with mocked API
   - Add to test suite

5. **Update Documentation**
   - Add provider documentation
   - Update examples
   - Add configuration guide
