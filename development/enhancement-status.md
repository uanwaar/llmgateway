# Enhancement Status — Realtime Transcription

How to use
- Purpose: Single source of truth for feature progress. Keep it short and current.
- When to update: After moving a task between states (Todo/In Progress/Blocked/Done), reaching a milestone, hitting a blocker, or finishing a PR.
- What to enter: Date, task IDs (from `realtime-transcription.tasks.md`), brief notes, links to PRs/commits/logs.

## Current Summary
- Feature flag: realtime.enabled = (development=true, production=false)
- WS path: /v1/realtime/transcribe — wired (handshake-only Phase 1, adapters integrated Phase 2)
- Providers: OpenAI (WS) — adapter integrated, Gemini Live — adapter integrated
- VAD modes: server_vad (default), semantic_vad (OpenAI), manual — implemented in Gemini adapter

## Milestones
- [x] M1: WS endpoint returns session.created (T03) — Phase 1 complete
- [x] M2: OpenAI path end-to-end transcript (T05) — adapter, normalization, E2E smoke via mock
- [x] M3: Gemini path end-to-end transcript (T06) — adapter, normalization, E2E smoke via mock
- [ ] M4: Limits/metrics/logging in place (T10–T11)
- [ ] M5: Docs, example, and smoke tests (T13–T15)

## Recent Updates
- 2025-08-21: Phase 2 - Provider adapters, event normalization, audio utils, and integration/E2E tests implemented.

Details:
- `src/providers/openai/realtime.adapter.js`: OpenAI WS client, event mapping, normalization, provider token support.
- `src/providers/gemini/realtime.adapter.js`: Gemini WS client, setup, AAD/manual VAD, normalization.
- `src/utils/realtime-normalizer.js`: Unified event mapping for OpenAI/Gemini.
- `src/utils/audio.js`: PCM16 validation, base64 framing, duration/chunk helpers.
- `src/services/realtime.service.js`: Adapter binding, provider token storage, session.update ack, audio guardrails, normalized relay.
- `tests/unit/normalizer.test.js`, `tests/unit/audio.test.js`: Unit tests for normalization and audio utils.
- `tests/integration/gateway-realtime.test.js`: Integration tests for OpenAI/Gemini adapters and event normalization.
- `tests/e2e/realtime-smoke.e2e.test.js`, `tests/e2e/realtime-gemini-smoke.e2e.test.js`: E2E smoke tests for OpenAI and Gemini via mock providers.

Test results:
- Unit tests: PASS (2 suites, 8 tests)
- Integration: PASS (OpenAI + Gemini normalization)
- E2E smoke: PASS (OpenAI + Gemini via mock)

Behavior:
- Client receives session.created, sends session.update (acknowledged locally), then provider adapter is bound and events are relayed/normalized.
- Audio chunk validation and error handling enforced.
- Server shutdown and test lifecycle hardened for CI.
