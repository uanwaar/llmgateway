# Enhancement Status — Realtime Transcription

How to use
- Purpose: Single source of truth for feature progress. Keep it short and current.
- When to update: After moving a task between states (Todo/In Progress/Blocked/Done), reaching a milestone, hitting a blocker, or finishing a PR.
- What to enter: Date, task IDs (from `realtime-transcription.tasks.md`), brief notes, links to PRs/commits/logs.

## Current Summary
- Feature flag: realtime.enabled = (development=true, production=false)
- WS path: /v1/realtime/transcription — migration pending (currently /v1/realtime/transcribe wired from Phase 1)
- Auth: gateway-managed standard provider API keys only (no client ephemeral tokens)
- Providers: OpenAI (WS transcription intent) — (not integrated), Gemini Live (SDK) — (not integrated)
- VAD modes: server_vad (default), semantic_vad (OpenAI), manual — (not implemented)

## Milestones
- [x] M1: WS endpoint returns session.created (T03) — Phase 1 complete
- [ ] M2: Migrate endpoint to /v1/realtime/transcription (T05)
- [ ] M3: OpenAI path end-to-end transcript (T06)
- [ ] M4: Gemini path end-to-end transcript via SDK (T07)
- [ ] M5: Limits/metrics/logging in place (T11–T12)
- [ ] M6: Docs, example, and smoke tests (T14–T16)

## Recent Updates
- 2025-08-21: Phase 1 - Realtime handshake implemented. Added config plumbing, WS upgrade handler, minimal controller and session service. Dev smoke test (examples/javascript/realtime-smoke.js) connected to the gateway and verified session.created → session.updated.

Details:
- `package.json`: added `ws@^8.17.0`.
- `config/default.yaml`: added `realtime` block (enabled=false by default); `config/development.yaml` enables realtime for local development.
- `src/config/index.js`: realtime schema/defaults validated and surfaced.
- `src/server.js`: added HTTP upgrade listener for `/v1/realtime/transcribe` (to be migrated to `/v1/realtime/transcription` in T05; safe reject when disabled).
- `src/controllers/realtime.controller.js`: WebSocketServer (noServer) with basic auth gate; emits `session.created` and stubs message/close handling.
- `src/services/realtime.service.js`: in-memory session registry, idle-timeout cleanup, simple `session.update` → `session.updated` flow.

Smoke test:
- Ran example `examples/javascript/realtime-smoke.js` against local server on port 8081; observed `session.created` and `session.updated` events.
